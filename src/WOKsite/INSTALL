
 Section A) of this paper is the Unix guidelines for installing 
 WOK on  SunOS, Linux, HP-UX and IRIX systems.

 


PRE-REQUISITES:
---------------

 On SunOS and IRIX WOK requires at least Tcl 7.5, Tclx 7.5.1 and Tk 4.1.
 On Linux you can use Tcl 8.0 or later.
 We suppose that on SunOS and IRIX, tcltk is installed in /usr/tcltk, and in /usr on Linux
 If it is not the case, modify the TCLHOME variable in the file /home/me/wok-C40/site/wokcfg.
 (We suppose you have downloaded this tarball in /home/me)

A) INSTALLATION on Unix like systems.
-------------------------------------

 This section assumes that you have never installed WOK on your system. Performing the
 four following steps will install WOK and create a minimal environment for working.

 1. From the current directory where this README is located, move to the sub-directory
    site. 
    % cd /home/me/wok-C40/site

 2. Configure WOK so that its administration files will be located in 
    </home/me/wokentities>. You do this by typing:

    % ./wokcfg configure /home/me/wokentities ~/wok

    This will create the directory /home/me/entities if it does not exist, then create
    a c-shell executable file ~/wok. This file will be your wok launcher. This file is 
    used in the next step.

 3. Insert in your ~/.tclshrc the lines listed in the file /home/me/wok-C40/site/tclshrc_Wok.
    This file is sourced by the tclsh shell at the beginning of a session.
    (See tclsh documentation for more information about the .tclshrc file.)

    At this point either you want to create WOK entitites or import files from a previously Cascade 
    source download. To create new entities from scratch execute step 4., to import files execute 
    step 5.

 4. Once configured, you can create minimal entities and tell WOK where to
    physically create them. The following command setup WOK environment so that they will be 
    implemented under the directory /home/me/workarea. These entities are a factory 
    (named  KAS below), a workshop ( say C40 ), and a workbench (ref).
	
    % mkdir /home/me/workarea
    % cd ~
    % ./wok setup /home/me/workarea KAS C40 ref


 5. You perform this step if you want to use WOK on a previously Cascade source download. 

    % mkdir /home/me/workarea
    % cd ~
    % ./wok import /home/me/workarea KAS C40 ref /somewhere/source/downloaded/CAS3.0
        or if you have the variable CASROOT already pointing to this location :
    % ./wok import /home/me/workarea KAS C40 ref $CASROOT
	
    This will create and populate the workbench KAS:C40:ref with all development units downloaded in
    directory /somewhere/source/downloaded/CAS3.0. You can build them using the WOK commands umake 
    and wprocess. See documentation for details.


 6. Then running wok and accessing previously created entities looks like this:

    % ~/wok
    tclsh> wokcd KAS:C40:ref
    KAS:C40:ref>

    At this point, you run wok by using the above created command ~/wok. No additional 
    operation is required.
    Note that the wok procedure can be placed in any directory listed in your path. 
    It can also be published to a set of developers by placing it in a shared location.


B) INSTALLATION on WindowsNT.
-----------------------------

 We suppose that you have doanloaded the zip archive for WOK in directory W:\wok-C31

    1. Open a MS-DOS command console and set the current directory as follow
    
      W:> cd wok-C31\site

    2. Configure WOK so that its administration files will be located 
       in directory W:/home/me/wokentities. (IMPORTANT : You must create the 
       directories W:/home/me/entities using the explorer or the command mkdir)
       You can now issue the following command (Note precise usage of / instead of \ below):

       W:\site> wokcfg.bat configure W:/wok-C31 W:/home/me/wokentities w:/home/me/wok.bat

       This will create the file w:/home/me/wok, your wok launcher.

    3. Tell WOK where to physically create entities. The following command setup WOK so that they will be 
       implemented under the directory W:/home/me/wokarea 
       (IMPORTANT : Create directory W:/home/me/wokarea before)

       W:\site> wokcfg.bat setup W:/wok-C31 W:/home/me/wokarea

    4. You can now use the wok.bat launcher to create entities.
       W:\home\me\wok.bat
       tclsh> source $env(WOKHOME)/site/CreateFactory.tcl
       tclsh> CreateFactory W:/home/me/wokarea KAS C30 ref /dev/null
