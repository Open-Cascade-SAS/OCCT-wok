<u>1. 1 What is WOK ?</u>
<br>WOK is a development environment. Using it you can organize the source
files of an application as a set of development units, build them using
a make like process and assemble results in toolkits (Unix like shareable
or DLL files) . All kind of platforms are supported.
<p>Developement units are gathered in entities named workbenches that can
be organized in a tree structure. Typically a workbench tree (also called
a workshop)&nbsp; allow you to manage a reference space ( the root workbench)&nbsp;
and private workspaces connected to it. In these workbenches only resides
files currently being modified. WOK automatically locates all needed components
during the build process (source files, include files, shareable etc..).
<p>WOK manages an integration process so that the modifications done in
a son workbench can be queued before being integrated in the reference
space. This minimize the time during the reference space in a inconsistant
state, and allow this reference area to be managed by only one or a few
or persons.
<p>WOK contains a C++&nbsp;extractor processor that allow you to create
C++ classes using the CDL language. CDL is the component definition language
of the OpenCascade programming platform.
